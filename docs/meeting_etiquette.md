## Meeting Etiquette

1. Respect other's time: Prepare an agenda and follow it.
Do not prolong the meeting unless necessary.
2. Arrive early to setup equipment and check up
for any problems.
3. Do not interrupt abruptly. Raise your hand or wait for the right
 moment to ask questions. If needed keep a Q&A session after each presentation.
4. Keep your phone on silent and out of sight to avoid distracting others.
5. Clean up after yourself.
