# Object Detection case study

## Comparison of models from FaceBook's Detectron-project and YOLOv3GPU

We compared the performance of models from FaceBook's Detectron project and YOLOv3GPU from Joseph Redmon, when different error sources were added. The models from FaceBook's Detectron project were FasterRCNN, MaskRCNN and RetinaNet.

## Error types used in the case study

* Gaussian blur

* Rain

* Snow

* JPEG compression

* Resolution change

### Gaussian blur
